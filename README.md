# First Bash Script

Upload your first bash script to this assignment and then make sure it runs correctly!  If you get a green checkmark, you're good to go!

Note, your bash script must end in .sh and be written on a linux machine or it will not run propperly.  In addition, it must have executable permissions, so before you upload it make sure to `chmod 755 scriptname.sh` where `scriptname.sh` is the name of your bash script.
